Notes about 'daptup' package in Debian
--------------------------------------

Daptup now has support of apt hooks. In theory, this means that any apt-based
package manager can run daptup inside. But, aptitude currently doesn't respect
needed apt hooks (bug #501158). Thus, until aptitude had resolved this issue,
you have to run 'daptup' explicitly if you have aptitude installed.
