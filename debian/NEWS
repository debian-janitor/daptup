daptup (0.8.0~svn140-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Daptup can now work without aptitude.  

  Command 'apt-get update' nows calls daptup automatically, so users of apt-get
  are no longer needed to call daptup explicitly. However, aptitude users
  should yet, due to bug in aptitude (see details in README.Debian).
